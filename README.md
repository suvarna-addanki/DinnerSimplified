# Key learnings

## React
This was my first significant project built with React.I really enjoyed using the framework and I felt comfortable building components and passing props. My main areas of progress were developing my understanding of the useState and useEffect hooks to trigger the API requests and to (re)-render components with data from the API, and using react router to create multiple pages in the app, enable navigation.



# Challenges

## React Bootstrap

First time exploring Bootstrap so I took some reading and experimentation to get to grips with the different class names, and I did struggle a lot at times but ultimately I gained a good grasp of the grid system containers, and breakpoints for responsive design.

# Future Features

Allow users to like and give rating for the recipes.
